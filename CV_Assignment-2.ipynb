    "A convolutional neural network (CNN or ConvNet) is a network architecture for deep learning that learns directly from data.\n",

    "CNNs are particularly useful for finding patterns in images to recognize objects, classes, and categories. They can also be quite effective for classifying audio, time-series, and signal data.\n",
    "A convolutional neural network can have tens or hundreds of layers that each learn to detect different features of an image. Filters are applied to each training image at different resolutions, and the output of each convolved image is used as the input to the next layer. The filters can start as very simple features, such as brightness and edges, and increase in complexity to features that uniquely define the object"

By breaking up the network into smaller pieces, it may be possible to parallelize some of the computation or distribute the network across multiple machines."

Most of the time, it refers to the way that the conveyed information, such as color, is coded digitally and how the image is stored, i.e., how is structured an image file. Several open or patented standards were proposed to create, manipulate, store and exchange digital images. They describe the format of image files, the algorithms of image encoding such as compression as well as the format of additional information often called metadata.\n",

For example, an order three tensor can be thought of as a list of matrices all of which have the same number of rows and columns. These matrices are tensors of order two and since they have all the same number of rows and columns, the tensor of order three is actually like a cuboid of numbers and we can find numbers by going along any of the three-axis. Each number is identified by the row, the column, and the depth at which it’s stored. We can formalize this idea in the concept of shape."
